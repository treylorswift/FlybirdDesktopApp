# Flybird Desktop App

Flybird Desktop App automates sending of direct messages to your Twitter followers, with a focus on soliciting newsletter subscriptions. Send up to 1000 messages per day.

### Features

- Cross platform application built using Electron & Node.js

- Downloads your complete follower list from Twitter at roughly 300k followers per hour. Download is resumable if interrupted. Followers can be updated/re-downloaded again later.

- Integrates with the Flybird web app for managing subscriptions at https://flybirdy.herokuapp.com. Quickly create a newsletter sign up page, then send the link to your followers with the Flybird Desktop App. You'll be notified by email when people sign up.

- Followers are displayed in a table. Sort by "Most Followers" (your most influential followers) or "Most Recently Followed" (the people who followed you most recently). Filter results by entering tags which will be matched against each user's Twitter bio.

- Message sending history is tracked to ensure each follower is contacted only once. Message sends are scheduled to avoid hitting Twitter API rate limit errors.
 
- A separate "Sandbox" message history allows you to simulate sending of messages to see how the program operates without actually sending real messages.
